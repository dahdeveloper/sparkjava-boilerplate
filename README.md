# Proper boilerplate project for Spark #
This is a boilerplate project for developing lightweight web apps with [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/)- a micro framework for creating web apps in Java 8 with minimal effort.

This project contains simple implementations of commonly needed features like localization and authorization with simple role based security. The file structure is organized using a ["package by feature"](http://www.javapractices.com/topic/TopicAction.do?Id=205) style, which has advantages over the standard "package by layer" approach, which is used everywhere. 
On the client side we have [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/)- a dead simple, responsive boilerplate for front-end that can be easily replaced by more complex solutions like [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/), [MDL](https://getmdl.io/) or whatever you want. All view templates are managed by the [Apache Velocity](https://velocity.apache.org/) template engine. It's simple, fast, and provides much more flexibility than rusty Java Server Pages. Also, for convenience, testing and simpler object construction used [Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice), but it can be easily removed if you prefer to do everything yourself.

More features will be added later, including API examples, database integration, unit and integration tests, etc.. There is a live example available on [Heroku](https://sparkjava-boilerplate.herokuapp.com)
